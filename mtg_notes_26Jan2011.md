# Meeting Notes - 26 Jan 2011 #
We discussed the best way to proceed with the development of our project and got a feel for the due dates of specific project pieces.  We assigned sections of the SDS document to group members.  We made tentative module decisions and assignments, as well.  We also discussed a plan for gathering data about locations on campus.
