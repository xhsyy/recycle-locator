Notes for recycle-locator
  * General Comments
    * Some confusion over icons; maybe we need an indication what each icon (on the map) stands for.
      * Idea: include a legend that's accessible through the menu?
    * There was discussion about malicious users / confirmation system; we decided that because of the app's small scale it wasn't likely to be a serious problem.
      * Idea: once the app detects that the user is close to an item on the map, add a soft pop-up (maybe at the top, in some unintrusive way) giving the option to confirm.
    * Customers also asked how the progress of multiple category-selection was going; we explained it would be a stretch feature.
    * Customers seemed to like the simplicity of the interface.
