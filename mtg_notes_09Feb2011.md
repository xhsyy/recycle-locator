# Meeting Notes - 09 Feb 2011 #
We discussed plans for developing the Beta release.  We decided to ask our customer whether recycle bins would be a useful item to track, and to suggest tracking computing labs instead.  We discussed things to add to our schedule.  We also held a lengthy discussion on data representation and the format of the information to be passed between the app and the web service.
